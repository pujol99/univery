# Features

### Next TODOS
optimize {upf: delivery, subject, user} read
    - Rethink database models (no exact subjects/deliveries repetitions in db)
    - Not look at deliveries known that have ended (only if doing a refresh has been seen
        ended)
    - (Crazy idea) use other users recent refreshes in same delivery to save computation
show name of month or day in calendar

### Next big features
Create welcome page for users not logged in Showing web image and description of the web

### Problems
if load is slow the popup can be seen before it disappears
canceling load of page while doing deliveries refresh makes button fail
cant store hashed password bc of use recurrency
