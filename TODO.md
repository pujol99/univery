### Next TODOS
* Rethink database models (no exact subjects/deliveries repetitions in db)
* Not look at deliveries known that have ended (only if doing a refresh has been seen ended)
* (Crazy idea) use other users recent refreshes in same delivery to save computation
* Mobile responsivness
* Better design 
* Better style
* download calendar to pdf
* Create welcome page for users not logged in Showing web image and description of the web
* Accept deliveries with no date
* is register necessary?

### Problems
