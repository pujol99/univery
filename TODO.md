### Next TODOS
* Better design (sass) 
* Mobile responsivness
* Better style
* errors pages
* Create welcome page for users not logged in Showing web image and description of the web

* check that (check_delivery_ended system) has no edge cases

* Accept deliveries with no date
* Not look at deliveries known that have ended (only if doing a refresh has been seen ended)
* (Crazy idea) use other users recent refreshes in same delivery to save computation
* is register necessary?
* calendar stay in same week after done/remove
* next url js problem (dirty href when open multiple popups)
* disable remember button as session password disappears

### Future
